# Random-Graph-Identifier-and-Company-Emails

**Part 1 - Analyzed randomly generated graphs and determine which algorithm created them**

'P1_Graphs` is a list containing 5 networkx graphs. Each of these graphs were generated by one of three possible algorithms:
* Preferential Attachment (`'PA'`)
* Small World with low probability of rewiring (`'SW_L'`)
* Small World with high probability of rewiring (`'SW_H'`)

**Part 2 - Company Email Network with attributes `Department` and `ManagementSalary`**

Network `G` represents a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.

The network contains the node attributes `Department` and `ManagementSalary`.

`Department` indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and `ManagementSalary` indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary.

**Part 2A - Salary Prediction**
Used network `G` to identify the people in the network with missing values for the node attribute `ManagementSalary` and predict whether or not these individuals are receiving a management position salary.

Created a matrix of node features using networkx, trained a sklearn classifier on nodes that have `ManagementSalary` data, and predicted a probability of the node receiving a management salary for nodes where `ManagementSalary` is missing.

Predictions are given as the probability that the corresponding employee is receiving a management position salary.

The evaluation metric for this task is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
